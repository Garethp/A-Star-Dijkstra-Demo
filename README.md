# A-Star Dijkstra Algorithm Demonstration

## How To Use

Quirks:
 * "Speed" is the number of miliseconds used for the `setTimeout` between moves. Set to `1000` to have it do one run per second
 * "Run One Step" only works once you've already clicked "Run"
 * The above features only works once you've already hit "Toggle Debug"

Steps For Use:
 * Set a Start and End Point
 * Click "Toggle Debug"
 * Change speed to "1000"
 * Click "Run"
 * If you want to go step by step, immediately click "Stop" and then you can use "Run One Step"
